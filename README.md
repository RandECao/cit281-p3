# Project 3

Throughout this project, I further refined my skills in breaking down complex projects into manageable components. 
Additionally, I deepened my understanding of executing Node.js JavaScript code that does not involve web 
server functionality. I expanded my knowledge by exploring the fastify framework and implementing a GET route 
to retrieve and return specific values. This experience provided valuable insights into building efficient and 
effective Node.js applications.


### Skills Used in Project
- Initialized the folder as a git repository, enabling version control and collaboration.
- Created a code module consisting of several essential functions, showcasing my ability to encapsulate logic and promote code reusability. 
-
   - validDenomination(coin)
   - valueFromCoinObject(obj)
   - valueFromArray(arr)
   - coinCount(...coinage)
  
- Verified the functionality of the provided code using console.log, ensuring its proper execution and expected output.
- Implemented two parameters, namely denom and count, for the specified coin, allowing flexibility in defining coin denominations and quantities.
- Developed an HTML file that can be easily displayed in a web browser by navigating to the IP address and port associated with the project web server. This  integration enhances the accessibility and user-friendliness of the application.
